Tag Summary: Merge latest trunk tag into marbl_dev

             This merge brings in
             1) Namelist parm to perturb initial conditions
             2) Bugfix for reading r4 restart history file
             3) Bugfix in a couple test definitions (history files weren't
                written at expected frequency)

Testing:     aux_pop_MARBL on hobart (nag, intel, pgi) and yellowstone (intel,
             gnu) all tests fail NLCOMP due to change in dust flux varnames
             and the ecosys_dust_flux_driver tests fail baseline comparison
             due to round-off level changes (order of operations changed)

Tag Summary: Merge latest marbl_dev_klindsay (n97) into marbl_dev

             This merge brings in
             1) split dust flux into fine and coarse
             2) check tracer tendencies and surface fluxes from MARBL for NaNs
                (POP aborts if NaN is returned)

Tag Summary: Merge latest marbl_dev_klindsay (n94) into marbl_dev

             This merge brings in
             1) support for phys_cycle
             2) refactoring of D14C atm forcing in abio and ciso
             3) introduction and usage of forcing_timeseries_mod
             4) new CMIP6 D14C and d13C atm forcing datasets

Testing:     aux_pop_MARBL on cheyenne [intel, gnu] and hobart [nag, intel,
             pgi]; NLCOMP tests pass and baseline comparisons are bit-for-bit
             EXCEPT for
             1) abio transisent compsets (different transient dataset)
             2) ciso transient and non-transient compsets (different transient
             dataset and different PI value for d13c)
             3) cfc's and sf6 (different interpolation formula for atm forcing
             leads to roundoff changes)

Tag Summary: Merge latest marbl_dev_levy (n125) into marbl_dev

             This update moves iron_frac_in_dust and iron_frac_in_bc from
             MARBL to POP

Testing:     aux_pop_MARBL is bit-for-bit with marbl_dev_n59, but the
             namelist comparisons fail because variables got moved from
             marbl_in to pop_in. (Tested on cheyenne [intel, gnu] and
             hobart [nag, intel, and pgi])

Tag Summary: Merge latest marbl_dev_levy (n121) into marbl_dev

             This adds more MARBL variables to marbl_in (only via user_nl_pop,
             there are no new default values for them)

Testing:     Verified that preview_namelists still runs, and then when setting
             these PFT variables to the defaults set in the fortran code then
             POP is bit-for-bit. I don't think running the test suite is
             necessary to verify these changes work as expected.

Tag Summary: Merge latest marbl_dev_levy (n119) into marbl_dev

             This brings MARBL up to 0.20.0 (this version of MARBL improves
             the initialization process in MARBL)

Testing:     aux_pop and aux_pop_MARBL on cheyenne and yellowstone;
             aux_pop_MARBL on hobart. This tag is bit-for-bit with
             marbl_dev_n57 but all NLCOMP tests fail due to changes in how
             MARBL is initialized (introduces marbl_in to handle all MARBL
             parameters, and also adds some parameters that previously were
             not available via namelist)

Tag Summary: merge latest marbl_dev_levy (n104) into marbl_dev

             This updates aux_pop_MARBL tests to use gx1v7 instead of gx1v6

             on cheyenne, yellowstone, and hobart (updated my sandbox to
             later version of CICE, which changed answers in G compsets...
             in addition to the 1 degree tests not having baselines to compare
             against given the resolution change)

Tag Summary: Update MARBL from 0.19.0 to 0.19.1

             Lots of small code-cleanup changes, but nothing that changes the

Testing:     aux_pop_MARBL was bit-for-bit (and NLCOMP tests all passed) on hobart

Tag Summary: merge latest marbl_dev_levy (n100) into marbl_dev

             * Update to marbl0.19.0 relese
             * Clean up MARBL namelist interface (MARBL no longer sets string
               length or array size as build-time parameters)
             * Correct diagnostic name from diatbSi_form to diat_bSi_form

Testing:     Changes in MARBL are answer-changing, so baseline comparisons in
             aux_pop_MARBL fail. Namelist comparisons still pass; ran test
             suite on cheyenne, yellowstone, and hobart

             *** Two PGI tests on hobart fail in the MODEL_BUILD phase:

      SMS.T62_g37.C1850ECO.hobart_pgi.pop-ecosys_ladjust_bury_coeff
      SMS.T62_g37.C1850ECO.hobart_pgi.pop-ecosys_read_fallback_gx3v7

             The tests build fine individually, but fail as part of the test
             suite. Maybe this is a CIME issue? (Something with the shared
             build?) I'll talk to Jim Edwards about this, but don't think it
             needs to hold up the tag.

Tag Summary: merge marbl_dev_klindsay_n73 in

             1) Change default parameters
             2) Rename compsets (CECO -> C1850ECO; GECO -> G1850ECO)
                Also added G1850ECOIAF
             3) sf6 & cfcs are both added to compsets together during
                transient runs; also improved logic surrounding check for
                appropriate sf6 / cfc datasets
             4) namelist option to set precip_fact to a constant
             5) Better logic surrounding whether to add alt_co2 variables to
                tavg output
             6) BUGFIX: processing of tavg_contents file was sometimes
                accessing unitialized rows of tavg_contents_request in
                tavg:init_tavg(); this sometimes led to hangs in global sums
                (in tavg_global()) because different tasks had different flags
                for which fields were being averaged. This also led to
                  inconsistent tavg buffer sizes.
             7) Added running means of global scalars to tavg output
             8) Added new consistency checks to help avoid issues like (6) in
                the future
             9) Fixed a bug in EBM -- correction terms were not being applied
                correctly
             10) Updated to latest version of MARBL, which includes a bug fix
                 for setting POC and POP related terms when ladjust_bury_coeff
                 is .true. and the surface flux for those terms is 0.
             11) Cleaned up code so we can test with nag compiler and DEBUG =
                 TRUE

Testing:     Ran aux_pop and aux_pop_MARBL on cheyenne and yellowstone (both
             intel and gnu) and aux_pop_MARBL on hobart (nag, intel, and pgi).
             Verified that all tests ran, baseline comparisons failed because
             compset names changed (but there were answer changes and namelist
             changes regardless).

Tag Summary: merge marbl_dev_levy (n91) back to marbl_dev

             Update default PE layouts on NCAR machines, add decompositions
             for a few missing layouts, and and a performance evaluation test
             to testmods_dir (and aux_pop testlist). Also fixed a bug in step_mod
             that prevented running without computing global budgets.

Testing:     aux_pop_MARBL on hobart (bit-for-bit with marbl_dev_n42) and cheyenne
             (not bit-for-bit because of layout changes). I'm still stuck in
             standby for yellowstone, so I didn't test there (but expect answer
             changes due to different PE layouts there as well)

             change lapply_nhx_surface_emis default value from false -> true
             and removed a couple of un-necessary tests from testmods_dir

Testing:     Generated new aux_pop_MARBL baselines with these source mods, then
             went back to marbl_dev_n41, changed lapply_nhx_surface_emis to .true.
             in namelist defaults file to match this tag, and compared that sandbox
             to new baselines. Was bit for bit on both hobart and yellowstone
             (NLCOMP failures because we renamed lapply_nhx_surface_emis to
             lcompute_nhx_surface_emis)

Tag Name:    pop2/branch_tags/marbl_dev_tags/marbl_dev_n40_cesm_pop_2_1_20170508
Tag Summary: MARBL bug fix caught by intel 17 debug testing (updating MARBL
             external from v0.14.0 -> v0.14.1)

Testing:     aux_pop_MARBL on cheyenne runs successfully (previously debug tests
             failed). ERS.G tests also failed with previous marbl_dev tag, but
             that was due to the CICE tag I was using (updated CICE tag in this
             round of testing, and those tests all pass as well).

             Note that using a sandbox based on cesm2_0_alpha06j requires updating
             CIME to cime5.3.0-alpha.12 if you use the "--queue" option when you
             launch create_test.

Tag Summary: Bring in marbl_dev_levy, which addressed 5 MARBL issues. The
             following required changes on the POP side as well:

             * MARBL diagnostic types are "reallocatable" so they no longer
               have a diag_cnt variable; we use size() to determine number of
               diagnostics
             * MARBL domain type no longer has dz; previously it had both dz
               and delta_z denoting the same value (level thickness)
             * No locmip_k1_k2_bug_fix variable any more; it had already been
               removed from the namelist, but I found one last remnant of an
               XML variable in build-namelist to clean up

Testing:     aux_pop with cime5.3.0-alpha.07 and cice5_20170316 compared to
             baselines generated by previous tag [aux_pop_MARBL had been run
             on both yellowstone and hobart on the marbl_dev_levy side]

Tag Summary: Bring in marbl_dev_klindsay -- some changes below occur in MARBL,
             most require driver updates as well though.

             * Add lig tracer, reformulate iron scavenging
             * Variable P:C ratio => new tracer per autotroph
               -- implemented as option controlled by lvariable_PtoC
             * Move interior_restore_diags into interior_forcing_diags
             * Elemental Jint integrals shouldn't have restoring
             * Move river fluxes out of MARBL (GCM passes them as external
               forcing)
             * Bug in P-limitation formula was fixed
             * Wanninkhof 2014 for Schmidt numbers and xkw_coeff
             * Add ALK_ALT_CO2 tracer and P_CaCO3_ALT_CO2 sinking particle

Testing:     aux_pop_MARBL with cime5.3.0-alpha.07 and cice5_20170316 compared
             to baselines generated by Keith; bit-for-bit on both yellowstone

Tag Summary: Bring in generalized interior forcing specification from
             marbl_dev_levy (also bumps MARBL to v0.10.0)

Testing:     Bit for bit with marbl_dev_n24 out of cesm2_0_beta04 sandbox
             on yellowstone_intel, yellowstone_gnu, and hobart_nag (aux_pop
             and aux_pop_MARBL testlists.) Changes in the way restoring is
             handled causes namelist fails in all CECO and GECO compsets but
             it is not answer-changing in the code.

Tag Summary: merge latest trunk tag onto marbl_dev (tested with
             cime5.2.0-alpha.9 in cesm2_0_beta04; nag required ww3_161014)

Testing:     Bit for bit with marbl_dev_n21 when rolling back cice from the
             version in cesm2_0_beta04 to the version in my last sandbox.
             Generated new baselines with beta04 sandbox due to changes in G
             and GECO compsets. [Comparisons were done with aux_pop on
             yellowstone_intel and aux_pop_MARBL on yellowstone_intel and
             yellowstone_gnu; new baselines generated with hobart_nag but it
             has been so long since POP worked with NAG that no baselines were
             available for testing.]

Tag Name:    pop2/branch_tags/marbl_dev_tags/marbl_dev_n22_cesm_pop_2_1_20161026
Tag Summary: 3 minor bug fixes
             1. MARBL status log not checked after calling
                set_interior_forcing()
             2. The "level" argument is ignored when accumulating 2D fields,
                but convention is to specify k=1; in accumulating some MARBL
                surface fluxes we were specifying k = diagnostic index
             3. Had an allocatable variable with dimension max_blocks_clinic
                when it should have been nblocks_clinic

             Also renamed a variable (FLUX_DIAGS) that was appearing in
             several different cases (flux_diags, FLUX_diags). The flux_diags
             name predates the change in MARBL to surface_forcing_diags, which
             is a more appropriate name on the driver side as well.

Tag Summary: Update MARBL to include NHx surface emission bugfix; update
             POP to use more recent initial condition file for CISO. Add tests
             to run with r4 tavg output instead of r8, and don't force PIO to
             use pnetcdf for some tests (should be default anyway, at least on
             yellowstone).

Tag Summary: merge Tony's 4D streams and addition ice coupler fields onto
             marbl_dev (came from marbl_dev_tc branch)

             Note that this tag changes answers for GECO cases because of the
             new terms in DUST_FLUX_CPL and BLACK_CARBON_FLUX_CPL; these
             fields do not affect prognostic variables by default, but answer
             change will affect prognostic variables if

             dust_flux_source = 'driver'
             iron_flux_source = 'driver-derived'

             Also, new namelist variables (to allow PT and S restoring via
             shr_stream file reads) cause namelist compare failures for all
             cases running with POP.

         All were bit-for-bit against baselines except the ecosys_restore test

         Also generated new baselines with cime4.5.13 (sometime between May 21
         and May 23, CISL broke netcdf module that was used by cime4.5.8)

Tag Summary: merge in work from marbl_dev_klindsay_n07 tag
             Update to version of MARBL that has support for dust_flux coming
             from the coupler (along with black_carbon_flux for computing
             iron_flux).

Testing: Ran the following suites with cime4.5.8 and cice5_20160401
         * aux_pop_MARBL (yellowstone_intel)
         * aux_pop_MARBL (yellowstone_gnu)
         * aux_pop_MARBL (hobart_nag)
         * aux_pop       (yellowstone_intel)
         All were bit-for-bit against baselines (n06 / n07 tags of this branch),
         the only FAILs were expected:
         1) there's a known issue with compare_namelist.pl in this CIME tag, so
            all the namelist comparison tests failed (adding new variables to a
            namelist should not trigger a failure and updating the comparison
            script results in a PASS)
         2) The SMS_Ld2_D test still fails on hobart because of a known issue in
            POP when running in DEBUG mode with the nag compiler
         3) The baseline compare of the cice_ecosys_dust_flux_driver test failed
            because that was a new test introduced in this tag - it tests a
            feature that didn't exist in previous tags. This test is a restart
            test, and it did pass the bit-for-bit restart test.

Tag Summary: Bring in latest MARBL tag, which fixes issue in ciso diagnostics
             for NAG and GNU (initializing a field_3d array that hasn't been
             allocated - should be field_2d array, but really we don't need
             to initialize at all because field is over-written in the
             compute_vertical_integral routine). Also, a couple of updates to
             get ciso running on hobart_nag out of the box:
             1. Update build-namelist so we only write ciso_atm_d1[34ac]_filename
                to namelist if ciso_atm_d1[34]c_opt is not 'const'
             2. Add a couple of ciso tests to aux_pop_MARBL for hobart_nag.
                I added SMS_Ld2 (2 day run) and SMS_Ld2_D (2 day run, with
                DEBUG = TRUE), both at T62_g37 resolution. Note that the DEBUG
                test fails in grid.F90, which is a known POP issue and not a
                problem with MARBL or the driver.

Testing:
        aux_pop_MARBL tests passed and are bit-for-bit with baselines from
        marbl_dev_n05 on yellowstone_intel. I added two new tests to the 
        hobart_nag part of the suite; all 4 tests pass and the 2 old tests
        were also bit-for-bit with baselines (on both hobart_nag and
        yellowstone_gnu)

Tag Summary: Merge changes from marbl_dev_levy (tracer_update branch of MARBL)

             This cleans up the tracer indexing, especially for cases using
             both the base ecosys and the ciso modules. Some namelist varibles
             dealing with surface averages / virtual fluxes have been moved
             from MARBL to the driver, and the POP routine that reads a block
             of tracers from an initial condition file has been re-factored to
             allow us to read ecosys tracers & ciso tracers one-by-one.
             (Rather than needing to know which tracers come from the base
             module and which come from ciso, each tracer now contains the
             name of it's tracer module in the metadata.)

Testing:
             All aux_pop and aux_pop_MARBL tests pass on yellowstone_intel.
             Baseline comparisons also pass, though some namelist comparisons
             fail (due to variables being moved from MARBL namelist to POP /
             driver namelist). Tested with CIME 4.4.8 and CICE 20160309. Will
             bring in latest trunk next, and the generate baselines (running
             hobart_nag on yellowstone with GNU compiler for wider testing).

Tag Summary: Update to newer version of MARBL that includes generalized
             surface forcing output data type (requires driver update as
             well). Note that we now zero out named fields when they are
             registered instead of requiring POP to call named_field_set with
             an array of zeros after registering new fields.
