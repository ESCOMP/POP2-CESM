Tag Summary: Bring in latest MARBL tag, which fixes issue in ciso diagnostics
             for NAG and GNU (initializing a field_3d array that hasn't been
             allocated - should be field_2d array, but really we don't need
             to initialize at all because field is over-written in the
             compute_vertical_integral routine). Also, a couple of updates to
             get ciso running on hobart_nag out of the box:
             1. Update build-namelist so we only write ciso_atm_d1[34ac]_filename
                to namelist if ciso_atm_d1[34]c_opt is not 'const'
             2. Add a couple of ciso tests to aux_pop_MARBL for hobart_nag.
                I added SMS_Ld2 (2 day run) and SMS_Ld2_D (2 day run, with
                DEBUG = TRUE), both at T62_g37 resolution. Note that the DEBUG
                test fails in grid.F90, which is a known POP issue and not a
                problem with MARBL or the driver.

Testing:
        aux_pop_MARBL tests passed and are bit-for-bit with baselines from
        marbl_dev_n05 on yellowstone_intel. I added two new tests to the 
        hobart_nag part of the suite; all 4 tests pass and the 2 old tests
        were also bit-for-bit with baselines (on both hobart_nag and
        yellowstone_gnu)

Tag Summary: Merge changes from marbl_dev_levy (tracer_update branch of MARBL)

             This cleans up the tracer indexing, especially for cases using
             both the base ecosys and the ciso modules. Some namelist varibles
             dealing with surface averages / virtual fluxes have been moved
             from MARBL to the driver, and the POP routine that reads a block
             of tracers from an initial condition file has been re-factored to
             allow us to read ecosys tracers & ciso tracers one-by-one.
             (Rather than needing to know which tracers come from the base
             module and which come from ciso, each tracer now contains the
             name of it's tracer module in the metadata.)

Testing:
             All aux_pop and aux_pop_MARBL tests pass on yellowstone_intel.
             Baseline comparisons also pass, though some namelist comparisons
             fail (due to variables being moved from MARBL namelist to POP /
             driver namelist). Tested with CIME 4.4.8 and CICE 20160309. Will
             bring in latest trunk next, and the generate baselines (running
             hobart_nag on yellowstone with GNU compiler for wider testing).

Tag Summary: Update to newer version of MARBL that includes generalized
             surface forcing output data type (requires driver update as
             well). Note that we now zero out named fields when they are
             registered instead of requiring POP to call named_field_set with
             an array of zeros after registering new fields.
