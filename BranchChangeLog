Tag Summary: only use Robert filter restart file scalars if they were read from restart file

switch to single definition of attribute name prefix of Robert filter restart file scalars

also do not read passive tracer Robert filter restart file scalars in hybrid runs,
   to be consistent with active tracers

Testing:
aux_pop_MARBL cheyenne/intel: (baseline comparison to rf_tracer_on_off_n00)
   all tests pass

passed a by-hand test of turning tracers on and off across branch runs with cheyenne/gnu

Tag Summary: add infrastructure to determine if file attribute values were read from a file

Testing:
(minimal because new infrastructure is not being utilized yet)
verified that results were not changed in a cheyenne/gnu G T62_g16 case with
   OCN_TRACER_MODULES: iage cfc sf6

Tag Summary: construct names of Robert filter restart file scalars from tracer name instead of from tracer index

Also, reading of Robert filter restart file scalars for passive tracers is
now done in subroutine rest_read_tracer_block of passive_tracer_tools.F90
(because passive tracer names are not known when subroutine read_restart
of restart.F90 is called). This subroutine needs to be able to compute
indices of tracers in the global tracer array. This is accomplished
by passing into each tracer module the initial index of that tracer
module's tracers in the global tracer array and passing that through
to rest_read_tracer_block.

Testing:
aux_pop_MARBL cheyenne/intel: (baseline comparison to rf_tracer_on_off_n00)
   except for tests mentioned below, all tests pass
      one MEMCOMP failure

passed a by-hand test of turning tracers on and off across branch runs with cheyenne/gnu
   this test previously failed
