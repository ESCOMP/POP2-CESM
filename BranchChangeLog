Tag Summary: Merge latest POP trunk tag

Testing:     aux_pop_MARBL with cime5.2.0-alpha.9 and cice5_20161021, compare
             to marbl_dev_n26
             1. Baseline comparisons are all bit-for-bit
             2. all namelist tests fail due to removal of moby_on

Tag Summary: Bring in generalized interior forcing specification from
             marbl_dev_levy (also bumps MARBL to v0.10.0)

Testing:     Bit for bit with marbl_dev_n24 out of cesm2_0_beta04 sandbox
             on yellowstone_intel, yellowstone_gnu, and hobart_nag (aux_pop
             and aux_pop_MARBL testlists.) Changes in the way restoring is
             handled causes namelist fails in all CECO and GECO compsets but
             it is not answer-changing in the code.

Tag Summary: merge latest trunk tag onto marbl_dev (tested with
             cime5.2.0-alpha.9 in cesm2_0_beta04; nag required ww3_161014)

Testing:     Bit for bit with marbl_dev_n21 when rolling back cice from the
             version in cesm2_0_beta04 to the version in my last sandbox.
             Generated new baselines with beta04 sandbox due to changes in G
             and GECO compsets. [Comparisons were done with aux_pop on
             yellowstone_intel and aux_pop_MARBL on yellowstone_intel and
             yellowstone_gnu; new baselines generated with hobart_nag but it
             has been so long since POP worked with NAG that no baselines were
             available for testing.]

Tag Name:    pop2/branch_tags/marbl_dev_tags/marbl_dev_n22_cesm_pop_2_1_20161026
Tag Summary: 3 minor bug fixes
             1. MARBL status log not checked after calling
                set_interior_forcing()
             2. The "level" argument is ignored when accumulating 2D fields,
                but convention is to specify k=1; in accumulating some MARBL
                surface fluxes we were specifying k = diagnostic index
             3. Had an allocatable variable with dimension max_blocks_clinic
                when it should have been nblocks_clinic

             Also renamed a variable (FLUX_DIAGS) that was appearing in
             several different cases (flux_diags, FLUX_diags). The flux_diags
             name predates the change in MARBL to surface_forcing_diags, which
             is a more appropriate name on the driver side as well.

Tag Summary: Update MARBL to include NHx surface emission bugfix; update
             POP to use more recent initial condition file for CISO. Add tests
             to run with r4 tavg output instead of r8, and don't force PIO to
             use pnetcdf for some tests (should be default anyway, at least on
             yellowstone).

Tag Summary: merge Tony's 4D streams and addition ice coupler fields onto
             marbl_dev (came from marbl_dev_tc branch)

             Note that this tag changes answers for GECO cases because of the
             new terms in DUST_FLUX_CPL and BLACK_CARBON_FLUX_CPL; these
             fields do not affect prognostic variables by default, but answer
             change will affect prognostic variables if

             dust_flux_source = 'driver'
             iron_flux_source = 'driver-derived'

             Also, new namelist variables (to allow PT and S restoring via
             shr_stream file reads) cause namelist compare failures for all
             cases running with POP.

         * aux_pop_MARBL (yellowstone_gnu)

         All were bit-for-bit against baselines except the ecosys_restore test

Tag Summary: merge in latest trunk tag

Testing: Ran the following suites with cime4.5.8 and cice5_20160401
         * aux_pop_MARBL (yellowstone_intel)
         * aux_pop_MARBL (yellowstone_gnu)
         Same as previous tag results: all were bit-for-bit against baselines
         (n07 tag), with some expected FAILS.

Tag Summary: merge in work from marbl_dev_klindsay_n07 tag
             Update to version of MARBL that has support for dust_flux coming
             from the coupler (along with black_carbon_flux for computing
             iron_flux).

Testing: Ran the following suites with cime4.5.8 and cice5_20160401
         * aux_pop_MARBL (yellowstone_intel)
         * aux_pop_MARBL (yellowstone_gnu)
         * aux_pop_MARBL (hobart_nag)
         * aux_pop       (yellowstone_intel)
         All were bit-for-bit against baselines (n06 / n07 tags of this branch),
         the only FAILs were expected:
         1) there's a known issue with compare_namelist.pl in this CIME tag, so
            all the namelist comparison tests failed (adding new variables to a
            namelist should not trigger a failure and updating the comparison
            script results in a PASS)
         2) The SMS_Ld2_D test still fails on hobart because of a known issue in
            POP when running in DEBUG mode with the nag compiler
         3) The baseline compare of the cice_ecosys_dust_flux_driver test failed
            because that was a new test introduced in this tag - it tests a
            feature that didn't exist in previous tags. This test is a restart
            test, and it did pass the bit-for-bit restart test.

Tag Summary: Bring in latest MARBL tag, which fixes issue in ciso diagnostics
             for NAG and GNU (initializing a field_3d array that hasn't been
             allocated - should be field_2d array, but really we don't need
             to initialize at all because field is over-written in the
             compute_vertical_integral routine). Also, a couple of updates to
             get ciso running on hobart_nag out of the box:
             1. Update build-namelist so we only write ciso_atm_d1[34ac]_filename
                to namelist if ciso_atm_d1[34]c_opt is not 'const'
             2. Add a couple of ciso tests to aux_pop_MARBL for hobart_nag.
                I added SMS_Ld2 (2 day run) and SMS_Ld2_D (2 day run, with
                DEBUG = TRUE), both at T62_g37 resolution. Note that the DEBUG
                test fails in grid.F90, which is a known POP issue and not a
                problem with MARBL or the driver.

Testing:
        aux_pop_MARBL tests passed and are bit-for-bit with baselines from
        marbl_dev_n05 on yellowstone_intel. I added two new tests to the 
        hobart_nag part of the suite; all 4 tests pass and the 2 old tests
        were also bit-for-bit with baselines (on both hobart_nag and
        yellowstone_gnu)

Tag Summary: Merge changes from marbl_dev_levy (tracer_update branch of MARBL)

             This cleans up the tracer indexing, especially for cases using
             both the base ecosys and the ciso modules. Some namelist varibles
             dealing with surface averages / virtual fluxes have been moved
             from MARBL to the driver, and the POP routine that reads a block
             of tracers from an initial condition file has been re-factored to
             allow us to read ecosys tracers & ciso tracers one-by-one.
             (Rather than needing to know which tracers come from the base
             module and which come from ciso, each tracer now contains the
             name of it's tracer module in the metadata.)

Testing:
             All aux_pop and aux_pop_MARBL tests pass on yellowstone_intel.
             Baseline comparisons also pass, though some namelist comparisons
             fail (due to variables being moved from MARBL namelist to POP /
             driver namelist). Tested with CIME 4.4.8 and CICE 20160309. Will
             bring in latest trunk next, and the generate baselines (running
             hobart_nag on yellowstone with GNU compiler for wider testing).

Tag Summary: Update to newer version of MARBL that includes generalized
             surface forcing output data type (requires driver update as
             well). Note that we now zero out named fields when they are
             registered instead of requiring POP to call named_field_set with
             an array of zeros after registering new fields.
