Tag Summary: New MARBL tag changes CISO tracer name

Testing:     aux_pop_MARBL on cheyenne and hobart; all tests fail NLCOMP
             because of changes to ciso_tracer_init_ext, but the BASELINE
             tests still pass (cprnc doesn't flag renamed variables).
             Tested with MARBL 18a287e (on bugfix/244).

Tag Summary: Introduce utils_mod.F90 with a utils_split() subroutine (splits a string
             into array of substrings when encountering a separator), and use that to
             split strings like "DIAG : frequency_operator" and "frequency1_operator1,
             frequency2_operator2, ..., frequencyN_operatorN" when reading marbl_diags_file

Tag Summary: First wave of clean-up following second code review
             1. Add $OMP END to loop in passive_tracers.F90
             2. Remove un-necessary tavg_id variables in ecosys_tavg.F90
             3. Better variable names relating to what streams different MARBL
                diagnostics belong in
             4. Use shr_string_countChar instead of clunky count(transfer()) construct
             5. accumulate_tavg_[23]d_col -> [23]d_sparse: handle array of columns not
                just single points!
             6. ecosys_diagnostics_operators_init will abort if there is an
                issue reading marbl_diags_file

Testing:     still builds with nag on hobart, bit-for-bit in one-off testing
             Tested with MARBL 09fdc45 (on enhancement/YAML-diagnostics branch).

Tag Summary: Code clean-up following Feb 2nd review
             1. Fortran: make use of marbl_stream_cnt and move an OpenMP loop
                         to pass contiguous block of STF from passive_tracers
             2. No need to copy MARBL_diag_to_tavg.py to Buildconf/ (run it
                directly from $CESMROOT/components/pop/.../)
             3. POP_ecosys_diagnostics.py improvements:
                i. 'properties' key should be used to populate 'diags' rather
                   than writing directly to file (so developers can play with
                   over-riding the budget defaults)
                ii. Set 'has surface flux' property correctly even if budget
                    terms are not requested so that later devs don't need to
                    know anything about STF if they want to turn on more
                    budget terms
             4. Refactor buildnml to get calls to put calls to MARBL wrappers
                in separate subroutines
             5. Set NT = NT + MARBL_NT inside "if 'ecosys'" block (doesn't
                change functionality since MARBL_NT = 0 if not ecosys)

Testing:     aux_pop_MARBL on hobart and cheyenne, all tests pass
             Tested with MARBL 09fdc45 (on enhancement/YAML-diagnostics branch).

Tag Summary: More code clean-up
             1. POP now creates Buildconf/popconf/marbl_diagnostics_list to track
                which diagnostics belong to MARBL (needed to construct
                marbl_diagnostics_operators; better than relying on structure
                of ecosys_diagnostics)
             2. Restructure POP_ecosys_diagnostics.py with eye towards developers
                adding tracers in the future

Testing:     aux_pop_MARBL on hobart (nag, intel, pgi) and cheyenne (intel and
             gnu). All tests pass (no changes in diagnostic output)
             Tested with MARBL 389e1bc (on enhancement/YAML-diagnostics branch).

Tag Summary: Code clean-up following discussion at MARBL meeting
             1. Combine marbl_diagnostics and pop_ecosys_diagnostics into single
                file (named ecosys_diagnostics)
             2. Add more POP tracer diagnostics using never_average so they are
                checked in testing
             3. build-namelist no longer needs ecosys_cfg to determine arguments
                to ocn.ecosys.tavg.csh

Testing:     aux_pop_MARBL on hobart (nag, intel, pgi) and cheyenne (intel and
             gnu). All tests pass because additional output fields don't trigger
             BASELINE failures.

Tag Summary: POP's ecosystem diagnostics come from pop_ecosys_diagnostics (same format
             as marbl_diagnostics). It is generated by the new script
             MARBL_scripts/MARBL_wrappers/POP_ecosys_diagnostics.py and lets us
             pare down ocn.ecosys.tavg.csh quite a bit (and also remove
             ocn.ciso.tavg.csh altogether).

             This tag adds quite a bit of diagnostic output when lecosys_tavg_all
             is set to .true. but should not change the output when that variable
             is .false.

Testing:     aux_pop_MARBL on hobart (nag, intel, pgi) and cheyenne (intel and
             gnu). All tests pass because additional output fields don't trigger
             BASELINE failures... but it is common to see

              A total number of    173 fields on file 1 were not found on file2.

              or

              A total number of    261 fields on file 1 were not found on file2.

              (former without ciso, latter with)

Tag Summary: Code clean-up following quick review of ecosys_diagnostics_operators_mod.F90
             1. max_marbl_streams in computed on the fly rather set as parameter
             2. Allow marbl_diagnostics_operators to be edited in SourceMods, but the
                MARBL_diags_to_tavg.py script was edited to ensure variables do not
                occur multiple times.

Tag Summary: Code clean-up following quick review of ecosys_diagnostics_operators_mod.F90
             1. Better variable / subroutine names
             2. Better use of intrinsic string operators (e.g. index() instead of
                looping over every character)
             Also cleaned up the MARBL_diags_to_tavg script and moved more diags
             to the MARBL framework (so I can remove them from the tavg.csh
             scripts)

Tag Summary: Clean up ecosys_diagnostics_operators_mod, introduce check to make sure
             diagnostics in file are being passed from MARBL via interface

Testing:     aux_pop_MARBL on hobart (nag, intel, pgi); all tests pass except the
             multi-instance test introduced in 144 (BASELINE failure only in the
             second instance). It turns out that the test suite assumes both
             instances are identical so it compares 0002 (lsource_sink = .false.)
             to a baseline of 0001 (lsource_sink = .true.); asking CIME folks if
             there's a way to get both baselines saved.

Tag Summary: Introduce ecosys_diagnostics_operators_mod to parse the
             marbl_diagnostics_operators file; currently nothing is done with
             this input, but next step will be to only define tavg fields
             for MARBL diagnostics that are listed in that file (that will
             require a mapping from diag index in marbl_diagnostics_operators
             to the diag index used internally by MARBL)

Testing:     ran preview_namelists and a stand-alone CISO test to make sure
             tavg_contents looks okay.

Tag Summary: MARBL_diags_to_tavg.py now also generates marbl_diagnostics_operators,
             a file containing all MARBL-defined diagnostics to be accumulated as
             well as the operator to use in accumulation (average for all diags
             right now); this will let me update the define_tavg_field() call
             to be more robust and responsive to what MARBL wants.

             This changes how ecosys_tavg_contents is generated because the
             script that updates ecosys_tavg_contents also creates this new
             file, and I changed some logic. For example, the python script
             now adds the _2 diagnostics when lMARBL_tavg_all is True instead
             of relying on ocn.ecosys.tavg.csh to do it.

Testing:     ran preview_namelists and a stand-alone CISO test to make sure
             tavg_contents looks okay.

Tag Summary: No longer receiving STF_O2 from marbl_diags, what also affects
             how tavg_STF_O2_2 is accumulated (now STF is passed to

Testing:     aux_pop_MARBL on hobart (nag, intel, pgi), all tests pass. Note that
             longname of STF_O2 changed from "Dissolved Oxygen Surface Flux" to
             "Dissolved Oxygen Surface Flux, excludes FvICE term" but cprnc doesn't
             pick up on metadata changes so baseline comparisons all pass still.

Tag Summary: More cleanup following code review
             1) Get {PO4,NO3,SiO3,ALK}_RESTORE_TEND back in history file
             2) Use latest MARBL, which has its own clean-up (new interface to
                MARBL_generate_settings_file.py)
             Requires MARBL 69bc8c8 (on enhancement/YAML_parameter_list)

Testing:     aux_pop_marbl on hobart (nag, intel, pgi) and cheyenne (intel
             and gnu) bit-for-bit with n135. NLFAIL on all tests due to
             change in marbl_in (init_bury_coeff_opt changed from "nml" to
             "settings_file" or from "restfile" to "GCM")

Tag Summary: More cleanup following code review
             1) marbl package name change: marbl_interface -> marbl_settings_wrapper
             2) marbl_class_dir var is not needed, just sys.path.append(os.path.join(...))
             3) buildcpp cleanup -- no need for ciso -> pass option
             4) marbl_settings.py -- comment clean up (JSON, not YAML; file name mismatch)
             5) there is var in marbl_settings.py (settings_class_dir) that shouldn't be
                duplicated in buildcpp and buildnml
             6) external/MARBL not external/marbl

Testing:     aux_pop_marbl on hobart (nag, intel, pgi) and cheyenne (intel

Tag Summary: Two big changes --
             1. buildnml gets MARBL_NT from config_cache.xml, will abort if
                MARBL_NT from configuration doesn't match how POP was built
             2. build-namelist no longer needs ciso in OCN_TRACER_MODULES

             Also a small change -- user_settings_marbl was renamed
             user_nl_marbl per request of CIME developers (may go back to
             user_settings_marbl after CESM 2)

Testing:     aux_pop_marbl on hobart (nag, intel, pgi) and yellowstone (intel
             and gnu) bit-for-bit with n132; uses MARBL 005be4e

Tag Summary: Introduce a new marbl_interface layer between build* and
             MARBL_tools; makes it easier to reuse code between buildcpp and
             buildnml, which is necessary because buildcpp now gets MARBL_NT
             from MARBL_tools. Requires MARBL a30eee3

             Still need to check MARBL_NT in buildnml to make sure it hasn't
             changed, but it isn't obvious how to pull in vars from
             config_cache.xml so I'll wait until n133 to do that.

Testing:     aux_pop_marbl on hobart is bit-for-bit with n131 (nag, intel,
             pgi)

Tag Summary: MARBL now offers JSON version of default_settings.yaml; POP
             should use that file since PyYAML is not a standard library in
             python.

             Also fixed a bug re: how init_bury_coeff_opt is set in MARBL (for
             the time being, it is up to POP to correctly set this variable
             via a put_setting() call)

             Note that this requires MARBL 5f774b0

Testing:     Ran aux_pop_marbl on cheyenne and hobart; I was able to produce
             baselines on both machines with work-arounds [but cheyenne
             flagged an issue with ladjust_bury_coeff that still needs to be
             fixed] so this tag is bit-for-bit with n130.

Tag Summary: Remove ciso_on from passive_tracers.F90 (ecosys_driver requests
             it from MARBL via get_setting()); also, MARBL gets tracer count
             from size(tracer_metadata) instead of intent(out) from init().

             Note that running with carbon isotopes is now a three-step
             process:
                i.   add ciso_on = .true. to user_settings_marbl
                ii.  add MARBL_NT = 46 to OCN_TRACER_MODULES_OPT
                iii. add ciso to OCN_TRACER_MODULES

Testing:     Ran aux_pop_marbl on hobart; NLCOMP failures because ciso_on is
             no longer in passive_tracers_nml but otherwise bit-for-bit
             [used MARBL commit bc8e4fc, currently on
             enhancement/YAML_parameter_list branch]

Tag Summary: MARBL provides tools to generate marbl_in so POP's build-namelist
             doesn't have to (cime_config/buildnml calls MARBL util instead);
             this requires changes to several of the testmod directories,
             since MARBL settings now go into user_settings_marbl instead of
             user_nl_pop. Caveats with this tag:

             1. There are cime changes necessary to copy user_settings_marbl
                into CASEROOT
             2. To run with carbon isotopes, four steps are needed
                i.   add ciso_on = .true. to user_settings_marbl
                ii.  add MARBL_NT = 46 to OCN_TRACER_MODULES_OPT
                iii. add ciso to OCN_TRACER_MODULES
                iv.  add ciso_on = .true. to user_nl_pop
             3. To run with variable P to C disabled, two steps are needed
                i.  add lvariable_PtoC = .false. to user_settings_marbl
                ii. add MARBL_NT = 29 to OCN_TRACER_MODULES_OPT

             Once MARBL is providing MARBL_NT, those requirements will go
             away, and once MARBL is telling POP what to put in tavg_contents
             the requirement to have ciso in OCN_TRACER_MODULES will go away.
             ciso_on will be removed from the POP namelist in the next
             marbl_dev_levy tag.

Testing:     Ran aux_pop_marbl on hobart, but both cheyenne and yellowstone
             are down. The tests with variable P to C disabled failed baseline
             comparisons because of the Qp_fixed setting in autotroph
             variables; the differences are round-off level and commenting out

             Qp_fixed :
                longname : P/C ratio when using fixed P/C ratios
                subcategory : 10. autotrophs
                units : unitless
                datatype : real
                default_value :
                    default : 1e34
                    autotrophs = "sp" : 1.0/117
                    autotrophs = "diat" : 1.0/117
                    autotrophs = "diaz" : 0.32/117

             gets us back to bit-for-bit. Note that hobart only tests gx3v7
             resolution runs (and only C compsets), so it is possible that
             more changes to the default values will be needed once we test
             with gx1v7. Also, all namelist comparisons fail because of the
             new format of marbl_in.

Tag Summary: Make sure all MARBL PFT variables are in namelist definitions and
             add 'user-specified' to valid_values list for PFT_defaults.

Testing:     Ensured the namelist build successfully and the model still runs
             on cheyenne and hobart

Tag Summary: Use MARBL's put() calls instead of namelist. For this tag, I
             brought MARBL's marbl_namelist_mod.F90 in to POP (as
             namelist_from_str_mod.F90) and also updated the build-namelist
             tool to match the input format MARBL is expecting (explicit
             indices on arrays of dimension 1 and not providing values for
             arrays of size 0). This requires MARBL 27d8837 or later (on the

             After code review, determined that the approach taken to making

Tag Summary: Remove some namelist parameters from MARBL => interface change

             MARBL shouldn't supply information about how many different
             namelists are in the namelist file or how long those namelists
             are - that's entirely up to the GCM.

Testing:     Built updated MARBL on yellowstone and hobart, ran some
             stand-alone tests. Also ran aux_pop_MARBL on hobart, these
             changes are bit-for-bit and don't affect the namelist comparison

Tag Summary: Clean-up following code review

             1. no_output test is now named "performance_eval"
                -- Added SMS_Ld20 tests to aux_pop (C and G compsets, both
                   T62_g16 for cheyenne_yellowstone)
             2. Collocating CPL and CICE for G.T62_g37 on cheyenne
             3. better default decompositions for some gx1v[67] layouts,
                plus added some tx1v1 layouts
                -- also, only support gx3v7, gx1v6, gx1v7, and tripole grids

Testing:     aux_pop_MARBL on cheyenne, yellowstone, and hobart (in progress
             when tag was made, yellowstone gets stuck in standby and I may
             kill it if it sits in the queue for too long)

Tag Summary: Better pe layouts on yellowstone, general clean-up of config_pes.xml,
             and starting to work towards cheyenne layouts as well. Note that
             C and G compsets on yellowstone now  run on 16 cores / node
             instead of the CESM default of 15, but do not turn on hyperthreading.

             Also added some decompositions to generate_pop_decomp.xml and
             fixed a typo in the marbl_dev BranchChangeLog.

Testing:     Still no test suites to report, but I have verified that yellowstone
             timing numbers are showing more throughput.

Tag Summary: New testmods_dir for turning off all output (for performance
             tuning); also removed dependency on SWAV from default pe layouts.

             Found three bugs:
             1. step_mod.F90 was calling diag_for_tracer_budgets_rf_Sterms
                even if ldiag_global_tracer_budgets = .false. (fixed in tag)
             2. Domain file missing for gx1v7, so C / CECO compsets fail
                (reported on CIME issue page by dbailey)
             3. Problem reading river inputs on gx1v7 (GECO compset fails,
                this issue has not been addressed yet)

Testing:     None for this branch, going to do some timing studies and update
             default PE layouts for C, CECO, G, GECO,

Tag Summary: Code cleanup following review
             * accumulate_tavg_field_3d_col doesn't access data below KMT
             * ecosys_driver only calls MARBL set_surface_forcing if block has
               non-zero number of active ocean points

Testing: bit-for-bit with aux_pop_MARBL on hobart and yellowstone (compared to
         marbl_dev_n39); yellowstone had a couple of tests not run, but glade
         has been awful all day.

Tag Summary: Code clean-up following review of MARBL bugfixes; POP comment was
             that we should indent associate statements, plus tests were run
             with MARBL clean-up.

Testing:     aux_pop_MARBL on hobart and yellowstone (ran full aux_pop on
             marbl_dev_levy_n78, don't think we need that suite for these
             clean-ups)

Tag Summary: Support for some MARBL bugfixes
             5. Remove locmip_k1_k2 bug fix namelist option
                It looks like the namelist variable was already removed, but
                there was a line in build-namelist looking for an XML variable
                that also was removed so I cleaned that up

Testing:     Simple run check on hobart_nag (will run full aux_pop_MARBL on
             hobart and yellowstone after all five branches are merged)

Tag Summary: Support for some MARBL bugfixes
             1. Makefile cleanup did not change POP
             2. Cleaning up how parameters are written to log did not change
                POP
             3. Reallocating the diagnostic type required some POP updates
                because I removed diag_cnt from the type and the driver had
                been depending on it

Tag Summary: Fixes following Feb 10 code review
             * more descriptive variable name
             * tighter error checking in tavg.F90
             -- must accumulate 3D transpose tavg vars column by column
             -- must accumulate standard 3D tavg vars level by level
             -- Only 3D vars can have tranpose_field = .true.
             * global sums for transpose variables done column by column
             * Track km on per-field basis for 3D vars (some fields are only
               accumulated to 150m)
             * some allocatable variables didn't need to be allocatable

Testing:     Bit-for-bit with marbl_dev__n28 in aux_pop_MARBL test suite
             testing with yellowstone_intel, yellowstone_gnu, hobart_nag, and
             hobart_intel

Tag Summary: MARBL timing data outputted as frequently as POP timers, rather
             than only being available at the end of the run. Requires eeda9fc

             library.

Tag Summary: Lots of clean-up following code review with klindsay. Some
             highlights --
             * Clean up field_source options in forcing_field_type: remove
               'marbl', change 'driver' to 'internal', change 'none' to 'zero',
               shorten 'constant' to 'const', and change 'file' to 'shr_stream'
             * Clearer namelist variable names for tracer restoring and also
               better array sizes in definitions (and better logic for size of
               restore_data_filenames in build-namelist)
             * Better error handling in restoring block

Testing:     Bit-for-bit with marbl_dev_levy_n53 in aux_pop_MARBL test suite
             testing with yellowstone_intel, yellowstone_gnu, and hobart_nag

Tag Summary: MARBL wants the GCM to provide the inverse timescale for
             restoring rather than computing it based on a piece-wise linear
             parameterization. I introduced the namelist variable
             restore_inv_tau_opt, which currently only accepts 'constant' as a
             valid value but will be expanded to 'file' as well in the future.
             The constant value used for inv_tau is determined by the
             restore_inv_tau_const namelist variable (default = 2.3e-6). It
             should be noted that the only testing we did previously used
             MARBL's piece-wise linear function to define inv_tau = 2.3e-6
             globally so this is bit-for-bit with the existing test suite.

             MARBL now provides the inverse timescale as diagnostic output,
             and POP writes it to tavg when lecosys_debug = .true. Note that
             this required increasing the maximum number of tavg fields.

             Requires MARBL 049465d

Testing:     Bit-for-bit with marbl_dev_n23 in aux_pop_MARBL test suite on
             yellowstone_intel, yellowstone_gnu, and hobart_nag (including the
             tracer restoring tests), except I added $NT new output fields
             because the inverse timescale is now available for history files.
             Also, the tests fail the NLCOMP because I added two new namelist
             variables to ecosys_forcing_nml (and also removed two variables
             from marbl_parms_nml which were only written by the
             ecosys_restore_gx3v7 test).

Tag Summary: First pass to make tracer restoring in MARBL functional again.
             Updates on the MARBL side allow the library to get the restoring
             fields directly from interior forcing, which means the POP driver
             doesn't need any restoring-specific code (beyond the namelist
             variables controlling how to read the data).

             Also fixed a bug with intent of ecosys_restart_file when reading
             running means from restart!

             Bit-for-bit with marbl_dev_n23 in aux_pop_MARBL test suite on
             yellowstone_intel, yellowstone_gnu, and hobart_nag (including the
             tracer restoring tests)

Tag Summary: Last of the code clean-up: all calls to exit_POP are preceded by
             a call to document that includes the subroutine name (most
             exit_POP calls are now just generic "stopping in [subname]").
             Also added documentation to the new ecosys modules (forcing and
             tracers_and_saved_state) briefly explaining the purpose of the
             modules, and explained why we need the *_file_loc variables.

             Also fixed a bug in the named_field forcing option (n45 will
             trigger a "not a valid choice" error)

Tag Summary: Round 2 of code clean-up following code review

             1) move surf_avg, vflux_flag, and related namelist variables (as
                well as the tracer_ref_val function) to ecosys_forcing

             2) Add a new forcing field data type for variables that come from
                the driver put are stored in a named_pair type. Right now that
                is just the atmospheric CO2, but probably makes sense to move
                several (all) of the fields that come from the driver over

             3) Create iron_frac_in_dust and iron_frac_in_bc module variables
                in ecosys_forcing_mod rather than using them from marbl_parms.
                This was achieved by calling marbl_instance%parameters%get in
                ecosys_driver and passing the resulting values to
                ecosys_forcing_init, where they are copied to the module
                variables.

Tag Summary: Round 1 of code clean-up following code review

             1) We had made a copy of forcing_monthly_every_ts in MARBL, but
                now that we are using that code in the driver we can just grab
                the type from passive_tracer_tools again.

             2) Since we don't write surf_avg_* to restart files, no need for
                the index name table (this should have been removed several
                tags ago!)

             3) Rename marbl_status_log to ecosys_status_log, since it is
                logging activity in the driver rather than MARBL

             4) We were setting tmp_nl_buffer for &ecosys_tracer_init_nml well
                before using it, which was confusing. It has been moved so
                that it is set just prior to the tracer_and_saved_state_init()
                call

             5) ecosys_forcing_read_restore_data has been renamed
                ecosys_forcing_read_interior_data

             6) set_defaults_tcr_rd has been renamed set_defaults_tracer_read

             7) tracer_read_update has been renamed set_tracer_read

Tag Summary: Climatology is not necessarily the right term to use to refer to

Tag Summary: Fix a bug in tracer restoring (on MARBL side), lots of code clean up
             * Datatypes brought to driver from MARBL no longer have "marbl_"
               in their name
             * Namelist defaults now include values for restore_short_names,
               restore_filenames, and restore_file_varnames; enabling tracer
               restore only requires setting MARBL namelist variable
               tracer_restore_vars
             * No need to pass marbl_tracer_cnt to ecosys_forcing_init()
               because the variable is available in ecosys_forcing_mod

Tag Summary: Tracer restoring now works.
             * Introduced a new marbl_forcing_file_type variable to allow
               cases where indices of tracer_restore_vars (in MARBL) are
               different from those of restore_short_names (in POP).
             * Uncommented code that read climatologies, made sure it used the
               new marbl_forcing_file_type variable instead of looking for
               file metadata from MARBL

             The ecosys_restore_gx3v7 namelist was missing the
             tracer_restore_vars variable, so I added that. Also removed a
             block of debugging code that I had left between "#if 0" and
             "#endif" statements in ecosys_driver.F90
             moved from MARBL.

             restore fields into the corect namelist (they are in
             &ecosys_forcing_data_nml) and we were passing an un-necessary
             field to ecosys_tracers_and_saved_state_init -- tracer_d_module
             is a derived type that contains tracer_name, so tracer_name is

Tag Summary: Previous order of calls in ecosys_driver_init() was not exactly
             restarting because the tracer short names weren't available in
             ecosys_tracers_and_saved_state_init()
             
             Also, I fixed two issues that cropped up in DEBUG tests:
             1) I now initialize all surface forcing indices to 0 and only
                update input_forcing_data() if the index is non-zero (i.e. if
                MARBL has requested the field)

             2) There was a bug in declaring intent(in) characters for some
                routines (I had used len=char_len when len=* was appropriate).

             to yellowstone for more extensive testing. Tracer restore should

             -- adds adjustable bury coefficient
Testing:     aux_pop_MARBL on yellowstone_intel and yellowstone_gnu; will
             run hobart_nag after tag is made and make n25 if necessary.
             Namelist comparisons fail because baseline does not include changes
             from n22 (or this tag), but I generated new baselines for future
             testing.

Tag Summary: Update driver to handle new interfaces to marbl (%config,
             %complete_config_and_init), update bld/ because all the namelists
             changed. This requires MARBL 2d05250.
Testing:     aux_pop_MARBL on yellowstone_intel and yellowstone_gnu; will
             run hobart_nag after tag is made and make n23 if necessary.
             Namelist comparisons fail due to reorganization of namelist
             variables.
Still to do: (1) MARBL expects the GCM to make sure it is returning the correct
                 number of tracers, but POP doesn't do that check yet.
             (2) Lots of clean-up in build-namelist and the namelist_defaults
                 to account for new namelist generation.

Tag Summary: Minor code clean up following second review of tracer_update work
             in MARBL. Biggest change is that the driver uses a new
             get_index() function to retrieve tracer indices from MARBL and
             store them as module variables (we do not need all the indices,
             just the ones corresponding to tracers with virtual fluxes).

Tag Summary: Working to remove all semantic knowledge of whether CISO tracers
             are enabled from the driver; also cleaned up the code by moving
             some tasks / variables from the driver to MARBL (and vice versa).
             This changes several aspects of how the driver interacts with
             MARBL. Notably:
             1. Rather than reading all ecosys tracers with a single call to
                file_read_tracer_block (and then doing the same for ciso
                tracers), ecosys_driver_init_tracers_and_saved_state loops
                over the tracer and calls file_read_single_tracer for each.
             2. The driver is no longer responsible for setting
                ecosys_tracer_used_cnt, that is done by MARBL when setting up
                the indices for the tracers. Instead, the driver passes a
                tracer count to MARBL to ensure the GCM and MARBL agree.
             3. Whether or not we use surface vals from the namelist for
                reference values in virtual flux computations is no longer an
                option, code behaves as if use_nml_surf_vals = .true. and
                there is no way to set it to false instead. The constants that
                come from the namelist are now in &ecosys_driver_nml rather
                than &ecosys_nml / &ecosys_ciso_nml (MARBL has no knowledge of
                whether the GCM is using virtual fluxes or not). Hence the
                changes in bld/
             If you want to use this tag, change the username in the URL for
             MARBL in SVN_EXTERNAL_DIRECTORIES from mnlevy1981 to your
             username (and let mlevy@ucar.edu know if you need access to the
             private repository)

Testing:
* CIME 4.4.8, CICE from 20160309
* Passes aux_pop and aux_pop_MARBL on yellowstone_intel (and baseline
  comparisons against the 20160317 POP trunk tag); some namelist comparisons
  fail due to 3. above
* Passes aux_pop_MARBL on hobart_nag, but no comparisons were run

Tag Summary: Update to MARBL tag that uses a more general surface forcing
             output type => updating the ecosys_driver as well. There are no
             longer hard-coded field names (such as flux_co2) in the surface
             forcing output type; similarly, the driver does not have flux_co2
             or totalChl arrays any more - instead, it uses a general
             surface_forcing_outputs array.
